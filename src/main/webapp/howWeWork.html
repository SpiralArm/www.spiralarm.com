            <h1>How We Deliver Successful Projects</h1>

            <p>If there was such a thing as a typical project, this is how it might run:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>There would be an <b>initial meeting</b> or conversation to allow us to gain an
                    understanding of your requirements.</li>
                <li>The outcome from this would be a short <b>proposal</b> document, detailing what would be
                done by when and for how much. </li>
                <li>Once engaged, we will set up a project web site so that all parties can view the progress,
                raise issues, store and discuss documents.</li>
            </ul>
			
			<p>Of course, every project is different, and we adapt to a working practice that best fits the project.</p>

            <p>We also work on a consultation basis, for situations where you need advice or support
            on developing an idea, and can also <b>host</b> your solution, providing support, offsite backups and monitoring.
            </p>

            <h2>Software development</h2>

            <p>Our development style can be described as <b>agile</b>. We like to complete a feature and
            release it&#8212;thereâ€™s no better test of software than for it to be running with
              real users. This also gives us, collectively, the opportunity to make course adjustments to the project
            at all levels.</p>

            <p>With regard to software development, we do the right thing: we have issue management, source control, automated
            builds, unit testing, automated static analysis, code review, code coverage reports, use standards
            when they exist, and document. </p>

            <p>We use <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/">trac</a>, an open source issue tracking system, that
             integrates with our source control to give you a clear view of how we are progressing
             with your project.
             </p>

             <h2>In summary</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Incremental delivery, to give a faster return on your investment.</li>
                    <li>Open and honest communication.</li>
                    <li>Built on best practices.</li>
                </ul>
