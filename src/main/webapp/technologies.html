            <h1>Java, Groovy, Grails</h1>
<p>
We have chosen Sun's open source Java platform as our preferred method of delivering solutions.
This gives us the widest range of options, scaling from mobile to large enterprise systems, using
the Java language. We can also develop web sites quickly using Groovy and Grails.
</p>

        <p>When the situation
requires it, we work with partners to bring in other skills, and have successfully done so in areas
of design and in using Microsoft technologies such as C#.
</p>

<p>The technologies we use include:</p>

<ul>

<li>Enterprise Java development (Java EE, formally J2EE) &#x2013; building web applications, using
technologies such as JPA, JDBC, Struts, servlets, JSP, JMS, JavaMail,
JAX with products such as Tomcat, JBoss, and the Apache web server.</li>

<li>Java Micro Edition (Java ME, formally J2ME) development, including Mobile Information
 Profile (MIDP) &#x2013; the dominant platform for mobile application development.</li>

<li>Web services &#x2013; loosely connecting systems using SOAP or REST.</li>

<li>Relational database design &#x2013; MySQL, Oracle, MS SQL-Server, Informix,
Postgres, Sybase. </li>

<li>Professional development &#x2013; unit tested, profiled, documented, reliable code.</li>

<li>XML and XSL &#x2013; for storage, exchange, presentation (including SVG) and
translation.</li>

<li>Cryptography &#x2013; making communications and storage safer.</li>


<li>Usability &#x2013; adapting interfaces for different devices with limited input.</li>

<li>E-commerce &#x2013; collecting payments and managing accounting records.</li>

<li>HTML, WAP, WML, RSS, ATOM &#x2013; markup for devices.</li>

<li>Handset support &#x2013; as a subscriber to handset manufacturer support programmes,
 we gain preferential access to their support teams, meaning we can resolve
 problems quickly. </li>

<li>Open Source &#x2013; we use open source software from Sun, Apache and IBM whenever
 possible to bring products to market quickly and reliably. </li>

</ul>
