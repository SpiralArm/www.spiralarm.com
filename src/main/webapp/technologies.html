            <h1>Scala, Lift, Java</h1>
<p>
We have chosen Sun's open source Java platform as our preferred method of delivering solutions.
This gives us the widest range of options, scaling from mobile to large enterprise systems, using
the Scala and Java languages. We can also develop web sites quickly using the Lift web framework.
</p>

<p>
When the situation requires it, we work with partners to bring in other skills, and have successfully done so in areas
of design and in using Microsoft technologies such as C#.
