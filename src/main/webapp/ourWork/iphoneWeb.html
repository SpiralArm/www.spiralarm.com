            <h1>Optimizing for the iPhone</h1>

            <p>Press release, 22 May 2008</p>

            <p><i>There's plenty you can do to make your service work well on the iPhone just by an extension of your web site.</i></p>

            <p>
            	We're all fans of iPhone applications, but remember that the iPhone has a great web browser, incorporating
            	advance features such as location detection, making it possible 
            	to create an iPhone experience from a web site.   When TRP asked Spiral Arm to help with their web site, TRP
            	had a strong idea for exactly how it should work.  The best technology fit was a Flash interface, and working with
            	Luke Hornsby that idea was realized together with an administrative interface to manage the web content. But Flash 
            	isn't an option on the iPhone.
            </p>
	
			<p>
				So when it came to the iPhone, the team selected a user experience that gave the web site a iPhone App-like feel, while
				preserving some of the key messages of the TRP web site.  We were able to use the same content, meaning that when the
				web site is updated, the iPhone interface is updated, while also linking into some of the iPhone applications, such as 
				the Maps application and the Contacts application.
