            <h1>Visualising Changing Data in 3D</h1>


            <p>
                Press release,  5 May 2005
            </p>


            <p>
                The Television Research Partnership has created new and exciting graph software that can create 2D or 3D animated
                bubble charts. This software is an excellent tool for presentations where one can truly
                visualise changes in trends over periods of time in complex information.
            </p>

            <p>For example, understanding the changing behaviour of demographics in a market
            involves many parameters, such as age, gender, channel genre, time of day, audience
            share, and viewing habits.  An ability to absorb this information&#8212;and how the
            information changes over time&#8212;through an intuitive graphical representation could
            lead to significant competitive advantage.
            </p>

            <p>
                TRP commissioned Spiral Arm to implement their vision, with Ed Walker supplying
                the look and feel design of the user interface.   Using Java 3D as a platform, Spiral
                Arm produced a player to render and animate the bubbles, plus a tool to generate
                bubble information from Microsoft Excel spreadsheets.  Clients install the Bubble
                Player once, and can then read any number of "bubble files" prepared by TRP.
            </p>

            <p>
                David Raybould, TRP's research director, worked with Spiral Arm to define and hone
                the application. With a first class degree in statistics and nine years experience in the
                field, he is a recognised expert in TV audience measurement and respondent level
                data in the UK.
            </p>

            <p>
                The product was developed in a number of iterations, with each producing a release
                that added functionality. This approach ensured that all parties had a clear
                understanding of how the project was progressing, and allowed flexibility to adjust
                the design from experience of using the product.
            </p>

            <p>The Bubble Generator is now available to TRP clients.</p>

            <p>The screen shot shows the Bubbles application displaying information about five TV channels.
            Each sphere represents a TV channel, and the position and size of the sphere corresponding to
            attributes of the channel. The arrow buttons at the bottom of the screen allow the scene to be
            rotated to gain alternative viewing angles. The play and pause buttons stop and start the animation
            of the bubbles, representing how channels change over time.</p>
