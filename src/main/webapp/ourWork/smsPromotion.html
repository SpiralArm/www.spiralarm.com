            <h1>SMS Promotion for the rest of us.</h1>

            <p>Press release, 01 November 2009</p>

            <p>SMS promotion was an expensive and time consuming business. Ordering a short code takes 6 to 8 weeks and then you need to pay for it 
            for twelve months. You needed to get clearance from the regulator and finally you could get someone to integrate the service.</p>
            
            <p>Now there is <a href="http://taykt.com/" target="_">Taykt</a> a new service from Spiral Arm Ltd that allows anyone to set up an SMS Promotion in less than 30 seconds. The 
            barrier to entry for SMS Promotion is gone.*</p>
		
		    <p><a href="taykt.com" target="_">Taykt</a> is free for people to create SMS promotions, the customers SMSing the service pay 25 pence for the useful information.</p>
