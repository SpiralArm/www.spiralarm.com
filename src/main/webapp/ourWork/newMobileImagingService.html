                Spiral Arm Software Powers New Mobile Service
            </h1>

        <p>
        Press release, 19 July 2004
        </p>


    <p><i>Images from camera to customer in just ten minutes now
     includes customers with mobile phones</i></p>


    <p>
    Mobile software company Spiral Arm today announced it has enabled infoimaging company Youview to launch their
    new mobile service.  The service solves the problem of getting images from producers to consumers in an
    efficient and timely manner &#x2013; from camera to customer in just ten minutes.
    </p>


    <p>Youview offer software and hosting to allow businesses to manage and distribute images
    to customers.  With the growing number of handsets capable of viewing images,
    the move to mobile makes sense.
    Robin Brownsell, Youview's founder said: &#8220;We believe our move to mobile smartphones
     will offer some of the most exciting and innovative opportunities in the future&#8221;.
    </p>

    <p>Spiral Arm extended Youview's image enabling technology to smartphones, and created the web site
    software to transmit phone-optimized images automatically.  The service runs at
    <a href="http://www.seemoreviews.com/">http://www.seemoreviews.com/</a>.</p>

    <p>&#8220;It's a great example of how companies can move into mobile&#8221;, said Richard Dallaway, Spiral
    Arm's director.  &#8220;We modified Youview's existing successful product to run on mobile phones, and provided
    the behind-the-scenes plumbing to make it work with the rest of Youview's business&#8221;.</p>

    <p>More companies are moving their web-based products and services onto mobile phones.  They gain more users,
    new uses of their services, an opportunity to bring in new revenue while also offering more convenience for their
    users.  This is happening now because mobile software is open to independent software companies.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Spiral Arm's professionalism and delivery oriented approach put them head and shoulders above other
    software houses we approached&#8221; said Fiona Brownsell, CEO of Youview.  &#8220;We are extending our image enabling
    technology into the mobile space to open up new revenue streams for handset manufacturers, operators and
    existing customers alike.  Spiral Arm provided a future proofed ubiquitous solution so we can deliver better,
    cheaper and faster than any of our competitors.&#8221;</p>
