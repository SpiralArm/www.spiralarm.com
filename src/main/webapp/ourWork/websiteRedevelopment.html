                Making a Valuable Web Site Better
            </h1>

            <p>
                Press release, 20 September 2007
            </p>


            <p><i>Updated site helps IT professionals volunteer to supply their skills to charities.</i></p>


            <p>The iT4Communities web site has updated functionality, accessibility, usability and  look and feelâ€”all
            of which contributes to the initiative&#8217;s ability to encourage companies and individuals with professional
            IT skills to volunteer for the benefit of the community.</p>

            <p>Spiral Arm was chosen as the supplier after competitive tender in December 2006.  The challenge was to
            take on-board an existing site that was previously outsourced, make feature enhancements, and improve the
            accessibility and usability.</p>

            <p>Taking on a code base developed elsewhere is a risk on a project with an aggressive timescale. The risk
            was reduced by making phased releases of the software. Each release gives everyone working on the project
            confidence in the progress that was being made, and also a chance to appraise and adjust the development,
            which happened a number of times.  The use of established open source Java&#174; technologies of Struts and
            Hibernate further reduced the risk of implementation.</p>

            <p>The enhancements include the addition of RSS, making volunteering opportunities easier to view, which
            helps with iT4Communities aim of bridging the gap between IT professionals and charities needing IT
            help.</p>

            <p>John Davies, Programme Manager at iT4C, said: &#8220;We were very pleased with the professional approach
            Spiral Arm took in upgrading our website, www.it4communities.org.uk.  The site is now better structured,
            more accessible and easier to use for all our visitors. The sophisticated database functionality and
            improved admin interface means more charities are now benefiting from our service and the excellent work
            of our IT volunteers.&#8221;</p>

            <p>Being Brighton based gives Spiral Arm access to a range of additional expertise.  For the accessibility
            and site design, Hobo Internet worked as an integral part of the team, conducting the usability study,
            designing the new look, and contributing advice and hands-on design skills.</p>
