            <h1>Enabling Advertisers to Run MMS Competitions</h1>

            <p>Press release,  14 July 2005</p>
            <p>
            Guardian Unlimited now offer a service that easily allows their readers to send in pictures from their phones or by email.
             The pictures can then be viewed online in a microsite format.  The technology allows The Guardian to run photo based
             competitions or to ask readers to submit pictures as reporters might. </p>
            <p>
            Sony Ericsson is sponsoring the first competition which runs for ten weeks. Readers are asked to send in images that
             &#8220;capture the summer&#8221;, and in return receive a chance to win prizes.  The Guardian Unlimited's professional
             photographers will critique the top three photos.
             </p>
            <p>
            The service is provided by Picmore, with technology from Spiral Arm.  It allows readers to send in their picture
            messages from mobile phones or by email.  Guardian staff can then view and manage the images from a web
             site, and select which ones automatically appear on a public microsite.  Robin Brownsell, from Picmore,
             reports that over the past year every national newspaper bar the Telegraph has used the technology to
              allow their readers to send in mobile phone images.
            </p>


            <p>The Picmore service is available for use by any publisher at <a href="http://www.picmore.com/">http://www.picmore.com/</a>. </p>
