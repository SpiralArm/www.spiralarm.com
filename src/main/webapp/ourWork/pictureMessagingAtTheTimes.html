            <p>
                Press release,  14 December 2004
            </p>

            <p>
                Readers of <i>The Times</i> can now send in picture messages to the newspaper.  Software
            from Spiral Arm Ltd enables <i>The Times</i> to receive the pictures and pick the best for
            publication.
            </p>

            <p>
                Running for five weeks, the "Phonetograpy Challenge" asks readers to send in
                pictures describing "what Christmas means to you".    To run the competition, <i>The Times</i>
                enlisted the Picmore service, which has licensed Spiral Arm's picture messaging,
                image processing and web interface software.
            </p>

            <p>
                Pictures and comments are send from a camera phone to a dedicate number, where it
                is processed by the Picmore service and made available to <i>The Times</i> staff on their
                desktops.  An easy-to-use web interface allows the pictures to be organized and
                selected for publication.
            </p>

            <p>Picmore is now available for use by any publisher at <a href="http://www.picmore.com/">http://www.picmore.com/</a>.</p>
