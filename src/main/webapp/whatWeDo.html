            <h1>What We Do</h1>

            <h2>Solve the whole problem</h2>

            <p>The aims of your project may have broad implications for your business.  We help with the
               whole solution.  By looking at the bigger picture of what you wish to achieve, we can deliver
               a better result.</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Help you design for your needs</b>
                    <p> Although we're a technology company, we don't specialise in just one area.  By using broad experience we can suggest directions, offer alternatives, and bring ideas. We speak the language of web applications, mobile sites and mobile applications, desktop application, systems integration, billing systems....and we can translate for you via consulting, helping frame the scope of projects, and delivering.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Build software</b>
                    <p> We always have a hands-on role in developing system.   Our development style can be described as agile. We like to complete a feature and release it—there’s no better test of software than for it to be running with real users. This also gives us, collectively, the opportunity to make course adjustments to the project at all levels.  And of course, this style gives you a return on your investment quickly.</p>
                    <p>With regard to software development, we do the right thing: we have issue management, source control, automated builds, unit testing, automated static analysis, code review, code coverage reports, use standards when they exist, and document.</p>
                </li> 
                <li>
                    <b>Bring together and manage the team</b>
                    <p> We have a track record of successfully working with others to bring in specialised skills where required, and managing the over-all process.  This is always transparent with open and honest communication. We don't outsource our responsibilities, and prefer to introduce you to great individuals who may be able to work with you on future projects.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Improve and iterate</b>
                    <p> We're a great believer in releasing and iterating, and in using user testing as a way to improve a product over time.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
