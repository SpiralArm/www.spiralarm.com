            <h1>About Us</h1>

            <p>Spiral Arm was founded in 2003 to build applications for the web, mobile devices and desktop. We're a software
            production company: we build and host products, and bring teams together to work on complete solutions for clients.</p>

            <p>Our background is in building server-side applications for enterprises in the publishing, financial,
            travel, automotive and IT consulting industries.  Our interest in mobile began when the senior staff worked
            with a UK publisher to launch a Palm OS and WAP-based TV listings service, whilst also developing open
            source mobile applications.  This combination of mobile and server-side skills enables us to write
            complete end-to-end systems: mobile and desktop applications that work with web sites, databases
            and web services.</p>

            <p>The founders are Richard Dallaway and Jonathan Ferguson.</p>
            
            <p>The company is registered with Companies House in England and Wales as company number 4899633 and
            is based in Brighton (approximately 50 minutes from central London).</p>

			<p>You can find us at The Werks, 45 Church Road, BN3 2BE</p>
