            <h1>Scala, Lift, Java</h1>
<p>
We use the Java platform as our preferred method of delivering solutions, giving us us a wide range of options, scaling from mobile to large enterprise systems.  We use the Scala and Java languages, and develop web sites quickly using the Lift web framework.
</p>

<p>
When the situation requires it, we work with partners to bring in other skills, and have successfully done so in areas of design and in using Microsoft technologies such as C#.
