            <h1>SMS Promotion for the Rest of Us.</h1>

            <p>Press release, 01 November 2009</p>

            <p>SMS promotion was an expensive and time consuming business. Ordering a short code takes time and a financial commitment; you needed to get clearance from the regulator; and finally you need to integrate SMS into your business.</p>
            
            <p>Now there is <a href="http://taykt.com/" target="_">Taykt</a>, a new service from Spiral Arm Ltd that allows anyone to set up an SMS promotion in less than 30 seconds, and for free.  The barrier to entry for SMS promotion is gone.</p>
		
		    <p>Use Taykt to create an SMS promotion, by selecting a word and entering the promotion message.  Anyone who texts in receives the promotion on their phone immediately. Taykt charges the person receiving the text 25p for this useful service. </p> 
		    
		<p>Taykt has a huge range of uses, from personally produced small-ads on posters to businesses wanting to start a conversation with their customers when out and about.  A growing list of uses can be found on the Taykt blog.</p>
