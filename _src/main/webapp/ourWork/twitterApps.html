            <h1>Plugging into Twitter</h1>

            <p>Press release, 21 April 2008</p>

            <p><i>Plumbing services into Twitter makes them more useful to users, and the information more timely.</i></p>

            <p>
            	As more people use Twitter it increasingly makes sense to offer services via the Twitter interface.  Using
            	the Twitter API (Application Programming Interface), Spiral Arm has added a number of features to Twitter users,
            	ranging from simple announcements to full applications.
            </p>
	
			<p>
				Sometimes a simple applications can offer a lot. "On The Hour" just does one thing: every hour, it
				tweets the time. But by doing so it breaks-up the cluttered timeline for Twitter users with a helpful
				"blank" icon, while also reminding anyone at their keyboard of how late it is.			
			</p>

			<p>
				Brighton Tide is an information Twitter application.  Every day at 6:30am it tweets the low tide
				times and heights for Brighton, UK.  This information is gathered from the council run visitbrighton.com web
				site and converted from GMT into the BST in the summer.
			</p>

			<p>
				At the other end of the scale, Puncher is a time-tracking application.  If you follow @puncher you can
				tweet when you start working, or switch projects, and Puncher makes a time report available to you
				via the web.  By offering Puncher on Twitter, users can punch in or out via a web browser, a 
				Twitter desktop application, by SMS,  via a mobile Twitter application, or any other 
				way with the Twitter API.
			</p>
