            <h1>Desktop Automation Tool Gives Advantage</h1>

            <p>Press release, 01 November 2007</p>

            <p>Companies can saving time, gain competitive advantage, and give better service to their customers by deploying automation tools, such as the one developed by Spiral Arm for Television Research Partnership.</p>

            <p>TRP provide their clients with time-critical information, based on gathering information from a variety of sources, processing the data, and producing bespoke reports which are sent out via email.  This is a process with many steps which staff performed under time pressure every day.</p>
	
			<p>Spiral Arm and TRP sat down and sketched out a tool that would automate much of this work.  By allowing staff to drag-and-drop components of the process into a workflow, an entire process can be automated and scheduled to run every day unattended.  Should a problem be encountered, the system can retry some actions or alert TRP via SMS.</p>

			<p>Excel, Access, FTP, email, text utilities, are among the components that can be used in the system.</p> 
            
            <p>A senior research manager at TRP described the system simply: "It's changed my life".</p>
